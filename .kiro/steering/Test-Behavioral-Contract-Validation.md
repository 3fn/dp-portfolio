# Behavioral Contract Validation Framework

**Date**: 2026-01-02
**Purpose**: Framework for validating behavioral contracts across web, iOS, and Android platforms
**Organization**: process-standard
**Scope**: cross-project
**Layer**: 2
**Relevant Tasks**: component-development, cross-platform-validation, testing
**Last Reviewed**: 2026-01-02

## Overview

The Behavioral Contract Validation Framework establishes criteria and processes for validating that component behavioral contracts are honored consistently across web, iOS, and Android platforms. This framework complements the Stemma System by providing concrete validation mechanisms for the behavioral contracts defined in component schemas.

**Key Principle**: Behavioral contracts define WHAT behavior occurs, not HOW it's implemented. Validation focuses on behavioral outcomes, not implementation details.

---

## What "Identical Behavior" Means Across Platforms

### Definition of Behavioral Equivalence

Two platform implementations are considered **behaviorally equivalent** when:

1. **Same Trigger Conditions**: The behavior is triggered by the same user actions or system events
2. **Same Observable Outcome**: The end result is functionally identical from the user's perspective
3. **Same State Transitions**: The component moves through the same logical states
4. **Same Accessibility Announcements**: Screen readers receive equivalent information

### What Behavioral Equivalence Does NOT Require

- **Identical Visual Rendering**: Platform-appropriate visual differences are acceptable
- **Identical Animation Timing**: Minor timing variations within tolerance are acceptable
- **Identical Implementation Code**: Different code achieving same behavior is expected
- **Identical Platform APIs**: Using platform-native APIs is encouraged

### Behavioral Equivalence Matrix

| Aspect | Must Be Identical | Can Vary |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| **Trigger conditions** | ✅ Yes | |
| **State transitions** | ✅ Yes | |
| **Accessibility semantics** | ✅ Yes | |
| **Error handling behavior** | ✅ Yes | |
| **Animation presence** | ✅ Yes | |
| **Animation timing** | | ✅ Within tolerance |
| **Visual styling** | | ✅ Platform-appropriate |
| **Haptic feedback** | | ✅ Platform-specific |
| **Native gestures** | | ✅ Platform conventions |

## Validation Criteria for Behavioral Contracts

### Basic Contract Validation (Required)

Every behavioral contract MUST pass these validation criteria:

#### 1.1 Trigger Validation
```yaml
validation_criteria:
  trigger_validation:
    description: Verify behavior triggers under correct conditions
    checks:
      - Behavior triggers on specified user action
      - Behavior triggers on specified system event
      - Behavior does NOT trigger on unrelated actions
      - Trigger conditions are consistent across platforms
    evidence_required:
      - Test case demonstrating trigger
      - Test case demonstrating non-trigger
```

#### 1.2 State Transition Validation
```yaml
validation_criteria:
  state_transition_validation:
    description: Verify component moves through correct states
    checks:
      - Initial state is correct
      - Intermediate states occur in correct order
      - Final state is correct
      - State transitions are reversible where specified
    evidence_required:
      - State diagram verification

```

### Full Contract Validation (Required for WCAG-referenced contracts)

## Validation Process

### Step 1: Contract Identification

1. Read component schema YAML file
2. Extract all contracts from `contracts` section
3. Note WCAG references for accessibility validation
4. Note platform list for cross-platform validation

### Step 2: Checklist Selection

1. For each contract, select appropriate validation checklist
2. If contract type not in standard checklists, create custom checklist
3. Ensure all four validation categories are covered:
   - Trigger validation
   - State validation
   - Outcome validation
   - Accessibility validation (if WCAG-referenced)

### Step 3: Platform-Specific Testing

1. Execute checklist items on web platform
2. Execute checklist items on iOS platform
3. Execute checklist items on Android platform
4. Document any platform-specific variations

### Step 4: Cross-Platform Comparison

1. Compare results across platforms
2. Identify any behavioral differences
3. Classify differences as:
   - **Acceptable**: Platform-appropriate variation
   - **Unacceptable**: Contract violation requiring fix

### Step 5: Documentation

1. Record validation results in completion document
2. Document any acceptable variations with rationale
3. Create issues for any contract violations
4. Update component schema if contracts need clarification

---

## Tolerance Levels

### Animation Timing Tolerance

```yaml

    tolerance: ±50ms
    rationale: Platform animation systems have inherent timing variations
    
  easing:
    tolerance: Visually similar curves acceptable
    rationale: Platform easing functions may not be mathematically identical
```

### Visual Appearance Tolerance

```yaml
visual_tolerance:
  color:
    tolerance: ±2 RGB values per channel
    rationale: Color rendering varies by platform and display
    
  spacing:
    tolerance: ±1px
    rationale: Subpixel rendering differences
    
  border_radius:
    tolerance: ±1px
    rationale: Platform rendering differences
```

### Behavioral Timing Tolerance

```yaml
behavioral_tolerance:
  debounce:
    tolerance: ±20ms
    rationale: Event loop timing variations
    
  callback_invocation:
    tolerance: Same frame or next frame
    rationale: Platform event handling differences
```
